# *Coup*

During the lab, we played a game of *Coup*, a social deduction game where you try to deprive others of influence (cards), through political assassination and, wait for it, coup. Everyone starts with two influence, characters which grant a unique action to perform on your turn. The brilliant twist, and my favorite part, is that you are free to perform any action belonging to any of the five characters, so long as no one calls (challenges) your bluff. As players gradually lose influence, whether by assassination, failed bluff, or coup, the last player with influence wins the game.

> The reference card shows the actions available to each character. Income, Forein Aid, and Coup are general actions anyone can take on their turn.

Games typically runs 10-15 minutes. Here's how our game went down:

# Session Report

**Setup** is simple: each player begins with two coins and two influence, face down, in front of them. Players are allowed to look at their characters but should not show them to others.

---

**Hannah's Turn**: Hannah uses the foreign aid action to collect two coins. Unfortunately for Hannah, James claims to have a Duke and blocks Hannah's foreign aid. Hannah laments in Shakespearean and yeilds her turn.

**Andre's Turn**: Andre also tries to take foreign aid. Unsurprisingly, James blocks Andre's foreign aid. Skeptical, Andre boldly challenges that James does not have a Duke. James flips over one of his cards to reveal a Duke and Andre is found to be incorrect. 

As penalty, Andre loses influence by flipping over one his cards to reveal a Contessa. James returns his Duke to the character deck, since it has been revealed, and draws a new character to replace the Duke.

> When a player challenges another player and the challenging player is shown to be wrong, they lose an influence and must reveal one of their cards as a penalty.

**James's Turn**: James tries to steal two coins from Andre. Andre blocks the steal. James challenges Andre on the block, but Andre flips his card to reveal a Captain, who can block steals. 

Since James is found to be wrong, James loses an influence and reveals an Ambassador. Andre returns his Captain to the character deck and draws a new card to replace the Captain.

**Shane's Turn**: Knowing that James returned his Duke to the deck earlier, Shane collects two coins using foreign aid, for a total of four.

**Hannah's Turn**: Hannah tries to steal from James, but James blocks it.

**Andre's Turn**: Andre steals two coins from Shane. Shane promises revenge.

**James's Turn**: James, noticing that Andre had successfully plundered Shane, also steals two coins from Shane.

**Shane's Turn**: In an attempt to recoup his losses, Shane collects two coins from foreign aid.

**Hannah's Turn**: Hannah also collects two coins from foreign aid.

**Andre's Turn**: Andre expends three coins to assassinate Shane. Shane blocks the assassination, claiming to have the Contessa. but Andre challenges Shane. Shane does not have a Contessa.

Shane loses influence for being the target of Andre's assassination and again for being called out on his bluff. He loses both cards simultaneously and is immediately wiped from existence.

**Hannah's Turn**: Hannah uses the Ambassador's ability to exchange cards with the character deck. She draws two cards, looks at them, and replaces her cards before returning two to the deck.

In an unexpected turn of events, James suddenly fumbles his remaining card and it flops onto the table, face up for everyone to see. James tries to recover but it is too late, everyone knows he holds the Captian.

**Andre's Turn**: Andre collects two coins from foreign aid.

**James's Turn**: James tries to steal two coins from Hannah, but Hannah blocks the steal. James chooses not to risk challenging Hannah, since Hannah was allowed to exchange cards earlier.

**Hannah's Turn**: Hannah collects two coins from foreign aid.

**Andre's Turn**: Andre expends three coins to assassinate Hannah. Hannah tries to block the assassination, claiming to have a Contessa. Andre challenges Hannah. Hannah reveals she does not have the Contessa. 

In an exact repeat of Shane's tragic demise, all of Hannah's influence is immediately obliterated, once for being assassinated, and again for being called out on her bluff. Only Andre and James remain.

**James's Turn**: James collects two coins from foreign aid.

**Andre's Turn**: Andre collects two coins from foreign aid as well. 

*It is at this moment we realize James will afford a coup before Andre can afford an assassination.*

**James's Turn**: James steals two coins from Andre. Andre is left with no coins and James has ammassed eight.

**Andre's Turn**: Andre collects two coins from foreign aid, knowing his time is up.

**James's Turn**: James expends seven coins for a coup on Andre's only remaining influence. James is the winner.

# Retrospective

At its core, I find that *Coup* is sort of an extension of Rock Paper Scissors in that each character has a strength and a vulnerability, but you are able to lie about whether you threw rock, paper, or scissors. Even though the rules are simple and easy to learn, they can breed interesting interactions because of the added bluffing aspect. 

I also found tbat *Coup* is very good at teaching itself to new players. I love that Coup comes with reference cards for each player, so that players do not have to pass around the instructions to refresh their memory.
