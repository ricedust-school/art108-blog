## 1. Write about your experience playing, what happened during play?

Loading into *Out Run* for the first time, the game asked me to select what soundtrack I wanted to play on the radio. With a pixelated hand over the radio dial, I could choose between three synthpop tracks, *Passing Breeze*, *Magical Sound Shower*, and *Splash Wave*, my favorite. 

My car idled at the starting line as the light turned green and I fumbled for the accelerator key. Gradually, the road started to materialize and then spread out from the horizon line. As my eyes adjusted to the 3D illusion, I couldn’t help but admire the technical feat of projecting and moving the 3D world around my vehicle on a 2D screen. Bushes and billboards started flying past me and I lost control and spun out. Luckily, I was resurrected in the middle of the road and continued on my way.

When Game Over eventually appeared, I realized that I wasn’t actually racing against other drivers, but rather the clock: I needed to reach the finish line before the timer while avoiding other road obstacles and other vehicles. Though I never accomplished this goal because the game is actually quite challenging, I did learn some techniques in my play sessions.

I discovered that I could shift gears, which shot my Ferrari down the road and into a tree at 300km/hr, violently flipping my car and surely killing both passengers. Learning from my mistakes, I started to downshift as I approached curves and upshifted to speed down straight roads.

This took me further than I’d been before, and to my pleasant surprise, the sky, buildings, and road began to change, bathing the world in a retro neon sunset. It seemed to me that the aesthetic and music direction of this game was crafted with love.

## 2. How is it different playing on an emulator vs playing the game on the original hardware or an arcade cabinet? You can talk about browser emulation or anything that you think might be different.

The motion simulator arcade cabinet, as revealed by a Google Search, is equipped with a steering wheel, stick shift, and pedals which you pilot from a hefty plastic seat. I imagine that the analogue capability of the wheel and pedals transcends the degree of control afforded by my on-off keyboard input. Even if I were to build a driving simulator complete with the same analogue input devices, I would surely lose out on the stereo sound space of the cabinet, the sensations of inserting a coin and pressing start, and the visual character of the monitor.
