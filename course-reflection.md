# Course Reflection

## What did you learn / what was most interesting?

I found the MDA framework most interesting. I had always understood games as a combination of mechanics, visuals, and audio that magically combined to evoke an emotional response or define an experience. In describing games, I could reduce my experience to something like a bundle of positive (or negative) attributes but could not say much more about how those attributes related to each other, or whether they were in and of themselves causes or effects. 

The MDA framework helped me to break down a game into its fundamental parts, mechanics, think about how they related to each other, dynamics, and reason about what impression the game has on the player, aesthetics. I remember feeling the framework click in my mind when I saw the bidirectional diagram of how mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics are experienced in order between the designer and player.

## Does the material seem connected?

I appreciate that the lectures and labs usually raised subjects in a very timely manner so that activities and discussions often raised subjects that I could apply in my own games. For example, right before I began to work on my first prototype for *Deputy Dirk*, I remember playing and analyzing MOBS INC., which partially inspired the gameplay loop.

The reading felt relevant and not overly drawn out, I had ample opportunity to play and write about mine and others’ games, and I had not one but two chances to design and develop a game. I’m really glad to be able to walk away with a complete game and the beginnings of my next one.
