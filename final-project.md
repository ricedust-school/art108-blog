# I may have overscoped.

*You would think that by now, working on my seventh game, I should know better than to write a game like this from scratch with little over a month to the deadline. And yet here I am writing this and here you are reading this.*

## How it started.

Everyone likes a good ending. One of my favorite feelings is sitting in a movie theater and watching credits roll as I surrender to complete bewilderment and imagination. The best endings feel like a divine conviction to create art and to go out and to share that feeling with as many people as possible. One of my lifelong ambitions is to pass on that same conviction, emotion, and inspiration in my work.

There are a handful of games that have made me feel this way and each time it has made me wonder where it comes from. Is it great writing? Great atmosphere? Great music?  So when the opportunity arose to make any game of my choosing in a month's time, I had no doubts about the sort of game I wanted to make. Only when I sat down to make it did I realize that a good ending needs a good beginning and a middle and everything in between.

## The greatest storytellers.

*Deputy Dirk*, my previous game, was a personal experiment in ludology; this time, I wanted to embrace narratology with zero compromises. This wasn't my first time writing a story. I had a basic grasp of the shape of a story but had never invested time to peek below the surface. 

Did you know Pixar offers an entire course in storytelling for free on Khan Academy? I didn't. In my first week, I spent my free time listening to story architects talk about their craft and hoarded their words in my notebook. I figured that sacrificing a week studying narrative was necessary if I wanted to write a compelling game. Gradually my character, his world, and his passions crystallized in a markdown document.

## The hard part.

![IMG_3224](https://github.com/ricedust-school/art108-blog/assets/62413269/26eae2ad-85cd-426b-a532-41f2eaf7d3f2)

In my drafts, I took care to include stage directions. Here, the crickets should chirp. Here, we should hear a train whistle. Here, the roar of a tunnel.
As one week turned into two weeks and two weeks turned into three, I was reminded of the excruciating honesty and relentless reflection that writing a story demands. 

In whatever spare time I could manage, I wrote. And when I wasn't writing, the same questions nagged me over and over. Am I involving the player enough? Where does the player fit into this story? I thought of *What Remains of Edith Finch*. In it, the player is ultimately not in control of their destiny but lives vicariously through the characters, experiencing the narrative as it was predestined. That, coincidentally, is a central theme of that story. Was my game the story or merely its conduit? Could a single story underpin my entire game? 

## How it's going.

I joke to those who know about my game that the universe conspired to send my game to an early death. Group projects and other coursework blindsided my plans and threw my Thanksgiving Break, which I had budgeted entirely to writing my game, into utter chaos. I found myself on the Monday after Thanksgiving Break burned out and disappointed in my progress. I had over 2000 words on a page, but no game. You can't playtest 2000 words on a page.

The reality set in that, ultimately, this was not a class in storytelling but a class in games. As it happens, failing fast is not only a mantra for game designers, it's also a repeated mantra for the storytellers at Pixar, and I had been failing quite slowly.

Some days ago, the words fell into the right places and I arrived at a final draft. Three acts. Fifteen scenes. Much work remains, and I reassure myself that it's worth doing because it's hard. Truth be told, I have no idea whether it is a good story, but it is an honest one.

## Post-presentation notes

![image](https://github.com/ricedust-school/art108-blog/assets/62413269/2401a5f4-66ba-4c70-bf0d-1c0c254d3099)

*12/11/23 Update:*

*Who was I writing this for?* 

I was struck by a certain sense of perspective on my way home. Without the pressure of my self-inflicted expectations, new ideas, images, and new musical phrases came out from hiding and I remembered momentarily, of that initial excitement I had when imagined this story.

I remember earlier today—and annoyingly while I was taking my math final—of imagining ways I might present a game I knew to be incomplete. For the past month, I witnessed my drafts transform and, at the same pace, I witnessed myself become numb to my own writing, as often happens over long projects.

The question I hoped to answer today was whether I had something viable in my hands. Truthfully, I would have been satisfied to leave these drafts behind and walk away with my newfound knowledge garnered from wrestling with Unity’s UI systems and integrating Yarn Spinner (more on that in a bit). I’m truly grateful for the feedback I did receive and I believe that it would be well worth my time to see where this path goes. But I’m getting ahead of myself.

## The story-building.

I touched on my process in the first half of this blog, but I did not go much beyond wailing about the passage of time and self-doubts about the viability of this game.

> Sidenote: The game is called *The Dusk Line* now, but I must admit *untitled psychological narrative game* was growing on me.

I really appreciated Andre’s question today about my process of putting together this screenplay. This process is very important to me, and I’ve spent a lot of time experimenting and refining it to meet my needs. Then again, I’ve never had two projects with the same creative process nor have I ever put it in writing, so this is only an estimate.

### 1. Free association.

This has never let me down. My first step, especially if inspiration is running low, is to open an empty markdown document, play Spotify, and then word dump. I believe this is the most important part of my process. I’m the kind of person who over-analyzes and frequently fixates on minor details no one will care about. Here, I get out of my own way and write things as they enter my consciousness. Poetry. Prose. Some of it coherent—most of it not.

When my words begin to slow, I take a step back and reread the wall of text. I’m looking for patterns and latent themes. Sometimes, I accidently write a sentence I like so much it ends up in the final draft or becomes the seed for my entire project. Other times, I catch a glimpse of some truth, some question, I want to explore further.

### 2. Character.

Typically, at this point, I have a world, concept, or atmosphere in mind. It’s fuzzy, poorly understood, but exciting to think about. I create a new document, `protagonist.md`, where I delineate what my character will care about, categorized into wants, needs, and obstacles. Wants will drive my character’s actions at first, but obstacles will help my character realize their needs. Of course, this is a highly opinionated model for character development, but it helps me identify stakes, a theme, and the basic form of my plot.

### 3. Major beats.

I dive head first into writing the most fundamental beats of my story as bullet points, divided by Act I, II, and III. Though this ended up being relatively concise, I found myself spending around a week rearranging and editing bullet points until I got to…

### 4. Drawing the rest of the owl.

> The outline view of my screenplay.

In writing, this game was primarily dialogue. I rested, heavily might I add, on the vision that I would have visuals and interactivity to complement and fulfill some of the major beats. As such, my screenplay also has plenty of stage directions to direct the action on screen and cue in different music and sound effects.

Unpredictably, this took the longest, and it was far from a linear process. I returned to my beat sheet plenty of times to edit and rearrange when the story did not work as well as I’d imagined. When I finished, only a week remained.

### 5. Storyboard.

I *initiated* this step but never completed it. Breaking my major beats into scenes and then from scenes into shots, I loosely sketched the composition of what I imagined the player would see at a given point. Ultimately, I hoped this would later guide my asset creation and scene building.
### 6. ??? Profit

Yeah… Clearly I never made it the step of visual design but I’m confident that the storyboarding would have saved me time and cut out the effort of thinking about framing and staging while creating art assets.

## Improvise, adapt, overcome.

As the presentation date neared, I still foolishly clung to the hope that I could put text on screen, *and* have a character controlled by the player, *and* have a score, *and* with sound design.

The first to go was all the visuals. It hurt that I’d already animated my character and wrote a controller, but I rationalized that text and score would be enough to at least deliver the emotional intent of my game.

The next to go was the music, and by extension any sound at all.

All that remained was dialogue.

I used [Yarn Spinner](https://docs.yarnspinner.dev/) to drive it. I found that it had been originally developed for *Night in the Woods* and was used in some of my favorite games, like *A Short Hike*. It was free and open source. It had some of the best documentation I’ve ever seen. It was an easy choice.

As I found out, Yarn was a full-on scripting language that could be used to singlehandedly drive logic for my game through stage directions. What’s more, the syntax was already quite similar to how I’d been writing my screenplay.

Integration into Unity was straightforward, and some helpful default components were provided. However, I wanted to go the bespoke route. I already had a clear vision of how I wanted text to be presented—like a text conversation—and no template existed for what I wanted to achieve. That meant I needed to design my own layout, animations, and logic and then *stitch* the layout to the Yarn Spinner API. When paired with a lack of sleep and all the sudden learning I was doing, I found this challenging.

Overlooking that, I really only have great things to say about Yarn Spinner. As seen above, there’s even a neat graph view in VS Code for visualizing nodes and their connections. I hope to keep working with it.

## Epilogue

![image](https://github.com/ricedust-school/art108-blog/assets/62413269/d1b166b2-25ae-40c4-9ac9-1be32e828f4e)

I’ve always been wary of sharing my work half-baked. It feels I’m showing my cards—or pulling back the curtains while the actors are still putting on their costumes. To some degree, I still feel that way. I face a dilemma where I want to deliver an experience intact yet still garner early feedback. 

I’ve come to appreciate that there’s a certain satisfaction, too, in seeing a game grow and improve over weeks and months, in seeing it forged and battle-hardened by developers, play-testers, and their feedback. This class is certainly proof of that. 

I look to tomorrow and think about adapting and importing the rest of my screenplay. I’m don’t know how long that will take, only that I’d probably be wrong.
