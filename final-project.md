# I may have overscoped.

*You would think that by now, working on my seventh game, I should know better than to write a game like this from scratch with little over a month to the deadline. And yet here I am writing this and here you are reading this.*

## How it started.

Everyone likes a good ending. One of my favorite feelings is sitting in a movie theater and watching credits roll as I surrender to complete bewilderment and imagination. The best endings feel like a divine conviction to create art and to go out and to share that feeling with as many people as possible. One of my lifelong ambitions is to pass on that same conviction, emotion, and inspiration in my work.

There are a handful of games that have made me feel this way and each time it has made me wonder where it comes from. Is it great writing? Great atmosphere? Great music?  So when the opportunity arose to make any game of my choosing in a month's time, I had no doubts about the sort of game I wanted to make. Only when I sat down to make it did I realize that a good ending needs a good beginning and a middle and everything in between.

## The greatest storytellers.

*Deputy Dirk*, my previous game, was a personal experiment in ludology; this time, I wanted to embrace narratology with zero compromises. This wasn't my first time writing a story. I had a basic grasp of the shape of a story but had never invested time to peek below the surface. 

Did you know Pixar offers an entire course in storytelling for free on Khan Academy? I didn't. In my first week, I spent my free time listening to story architects talk about their craft and hoarded their words in my notebook. I figured that sacrificing a week studying narrative was neccessary if I wanted to write a compelling game. Gradually my character, his world, and his passions crystallized in a markdown document.

## The hard part.

In my drafts, I took care to include 'stage directions.' Here, the crickets should chirp. Here, we should hear a train whistle. Here, the roar of a tunnel.
As one week turned into two weeks and two weeks turned into three, I was reminded of the excruciating honesty and relentless reflection that writing a story demands. 

In whatever spare time I could manage, I wrote. And when I wasn't writing, the same questions nagged me over and over. Am I involving the player enough? Where does the player fit into this story? I thought of *What Remains of Edith Finch*. In it, the player is ultimately not in control of their destiny but lives vicariously through the characters, experiencing the narrative as it was predestined. That, coincidentally, is a central theme of that story. Was my game the story or merely its conduit? Could a single story underpin my entire game? 

## How it's going.

I joke to those who know about my game that the universe conspired to send my game to an early death. Group projects and other coursework blindsided my plans and threw my Thanksgiving Break, which I had budgeted entirely to writing my game, into utter chaos. I found myself on the Monday after Thanksgiving Break burned out and disapointed in my progress. I had over 2000 words on a page, but no game. You can't playtest 2000 words on a page.

The reality set in that, ultimately, this was not a class in storytelling but a class in games. As it happens, failing fast is not only a mantra for game designers, it's also a mantra for the storytellers over at Pixar, and I had been failing quite slowly.

Some days ago, the words fell into the right places and I arrived at a final draft. Much work remains, and I reassure myself that it's worth doing because it's hard. Truth be told, I have no idea whether it is a good story, but it is an honest one.
