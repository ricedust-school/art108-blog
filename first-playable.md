# First Playable

This was probably my most smooth and successful development experience to date. I scoped appropriately and had time to regularly work on this game over several weeks.

To start, I became familiar with Alex’s work as an artist, and thought about ways which we could incorporate that art style into a game. I have always worked with pixel art, but I was happy to try working with high fidelity assets. 

We eventually landed of a sticker-themed top-down shooter about defending a bank vault, with a strong focus on player agility and precise shooting. Both of us were Counterstrike players, and we thought it would be fun to try and emulate that sense of gunplay and precision.

I communicated regularly with my partner, designer, and artist, Alex, about what we needed from each other, shared the progress we were making, and exchanged ideas about how to solve problems or improve the game. I even found myself taking more of a backseat to matters of game design because I felt Alex’s design intuition was very strong.

As a programmer, I leaned into my inherent desire to build systems and I took great delight in the code I was writing, even though I knew I would be the only one to see or appreciate it. I designed these systems to be clean and highly modular and I’ve even since used some of these in my other games:

- Drag and drop object pooling
- Audio cue event system
- Modular wave spawning based on weighted probabilities

I also had the chance to write the backing track for the game and design weapon sounds, each with a distinct character. I studied and took inspiration from the sound designs of Modern Warfare, which I think are the epitome of guttural and satisfying firearm sounds.

1. How did your players respond to your game?

Player had a positive reaction to our user interface and overall polish and completeness of the game.

Players also enjoyed the game feel, such as from shooting recoil, enemy collaterals, animations, and camera movement.

One of the mechanics I had hoped players would take advantage of was the roll, but most players did not know about or use this ability.

2. What do you plan to change or keep in your game based on this feedback?

We enlarged the grid size to reduce visual noise and increase visibility of projectiles. Speaking of which, we also adjusted the color of bullets and added a trail to help it pop against our background. 

The goal of the game was not entirely clear yet besides shooting burglars because we were still missing our core defend-the-vault mechanic. We hoped that this would increase the difficulty and also give the player a sense of objective.

Auditory feedback was also not present yet for killing or hitting an enemy, as well as firing the weapon.
