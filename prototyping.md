# *Risky Roads*

Players control a traveler on the board and take turns building roads using their playing cards to create the safest road for their traveler (or most risky road for other travelers). You win if you are the first to move your traveler onto the Red Joker.

In the first play session, my partner and I sorted out the core mechanic of the game, [pieces as map](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2964/pieces-map). With that in place, we decided on a simple objective: get your game piece from point A to point B. However, there was not yet a system for getting players from point A to point B.

*What would a pieces-as-map system look like? What tools could we give players to get them to the objective?*

After some thought, we decided on using numbered cards between 1-20 as board tiles. 

1. You played a numbered card down on your turn and then you tried to roll that number or higher on a 20 sided die.
2. If you rolled successfully, you could move your game piece to that card.
3. If you couldn't roll higher than the number on the card, that card would "drop" from the board and you'd be sent to the beginning.
4. The first player to reach the ending square would be the winner.

As I was numbering paper cards by hand using a marker, I had realized that a standard deck of playing cards would work just as well for our purposes, so we ditched paper cards and used a 12 sided die instead to better suit the playing cards. After some dry runs, we worked out a few more details:

- The game would be competitive rather than cooperative.
- We could use the one joker as a start square and the other joker as a finish.
- Each player holds three cards in their hand to choose from.
- Rather than going to the beginning on an unsuccessful roll, you would just go back one card so that you could keep most of your progress.

Walking away from the first play session, I was very happy with the foundations. The idea felt intuitive, almost as if the rules were writing themselves. However, I felt that the game was a little more luck-based than I'd like so I was trying to spot opportunities to inject agency.

In play session two, I explained the rules to a friend and found the game was pretty easy to teach and pick up in just a minute or two. I implemented a few ideas I'd had since the first playthrough in this game:

1. I expanded the player hand from 3 to 5 cards to encourage meaningful decision making.
2. I enforced a board pattern where red and black cards needed to alternate to create a checkerboard pattern. I hoped that this would inspire more creative gameplay by imposing limitations where before, any card could be played anywhere.

In 1v1's, I noticed that once one player had gotten a lead, it was difficult to catch up. I introduced a rule where in order to move onto the finish card, you had to roll 12 minus the card you came from. For example, in order to move from a 5 onto the winning card, you had to roll a 12 - 5 = 7 or higher. This gave players who were behind the opportunity to catch up by barring the leading player from easily gaining access to the finish card.

My friend quickly discovered a strategy to exploit this mechanic. Intentionally placing a low-value card in front of the finish card can act as a barrier for players who are ahead because the 12 minus rule required of the player a higher and thus more difficult roll in order to win. 

I was pretty pleased with these changes because it was evidence to me that the game had some latent complexity.

In the final play session, I made some last minute changes that took the game one step further.

Andre suggested that it might make more sense to increase the gap between the start and finish cards from 3 to 4 cards. The game felt better-paced and it was more elegant because it preserved the red-black-red-black alternating pattern between the two jokers.

Rather than roll a D12, I thought it might be interesting to experiment with rolling two D6 and summing them up instead, like Monopoly. This would weight the outcome towards 7 and make the extremes, 2 and 12, less likely. In play, I found it more satisfying to roll 2 D6's, and I felt it to be a better fit.

Additionally, it opened up the possibility for rolling doubles. Just for fun, I implemented the Monopoly mechanic of getting to move again when you roll a double, and I found this helped players that were lagging behind catch up and helped break the cycle of trailing behind another player.

## Wrapping Things Up

As I wrote the paper prototype and formalized the rules, I decided to call the game *Risky Roads* because I thought it captured something about the dynamics of the game. I call player game pieces *travelers* in keeping with the theme. I'm glad I got to test the game on more than three occasions because it helped me understand the game inside and out and fine tune the system.
