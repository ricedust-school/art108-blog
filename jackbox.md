## Rhythm Game

### Discuss mechanics and your experience with your peers in the game.

This game essentially had guitar hero mechanics, so clicking on a beat in time with the music, or as it crossed the threshold at the bottom of the screen. Another mechanic was the shared survival goal by tallying up everyone's points. I liked how this shared survival goal transformed the game into a coop experience, but also created opportunities to lay blame on teammates :)

### How does playing with an audience affect the game?

I actually only experienced this game as an audience member, so I really enjoyed how this game included the audience and even let audience members play a side game that contributed to their own survival goal. This sort of creates a rivalry where audience members try to outlast the real players.

## Texting Game

### Discuss mechanics and your experience with your peers in the game.

I think this game really touches upon all the best tenets of a party game. It creates an outlet for player expression by allowing players to move a cursor around to type phrases, and sets up many opportunities for humor by removing the ability to backspace. Players are encouraged to riff off of each others sentences for points. I think with a group of friends, this game could really shine. I do think one shortcoming of this game was that even though it rewards playing off of each other's sentences, the incentive is not really enough to cause this to happen in a natural way.

### How does playing with an audience affect the game?

The audience was an integral part to this game because the audience's feedback in the form of votes is one of the primary incentives to be funny and creative. Informally however, other players were also audience members because everyone's goal, on a higher level, was to evoke a reaction from everyone in the room.

## Brain Jar Game

### Discuss mechanics and your experience with your peers in the game.

This game combined many mechanics to keep the experience fresh. This game also opened up opportunities for personal expression, one of the keystones of party games (in my personal opinion, anyways). Players were assigned some object/entity to act out by imagining answers to prompts, and then these answers would be analyzed by other players to self organize into hidden categories. I think this game was teetering on the edge of *too much* complexity but I found reading people's answers to be entertaining.

### How does playing with an audience affect the game?

I think this game has a similar dynamic to the texting game in that answers are partially motivated by the desire to evoke a reaction from everyone in the room by being funny or creative.
