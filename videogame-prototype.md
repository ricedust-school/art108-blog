## Discussion

I think the game, as it stands, is a fun, self-contained, top-down shooter experience that feels good to play. 
Alex and I achieved mostly everything we had set out to do for this game, and one of our strengths was how well we scoped.
Even then, we slimmed down the game as we went, keeping only what was neccessary to the soul of the game.

I wanted to emphasize the feel of the game, taking care that every interaction was as satisfying as it could be.
I spent a good amount of time tuning the movement, rolling, and recoil to complement each other and boost the sensation of playing.
In a strange way, I'm also proud of the parts that are invisible to the player; I took great care in writing clean, performant and modular code, which
allowed me to quickly iterate on enemy AI and wave-spawning distributions.

On the art front, I took this as a chance to venture away from my typical pixel art style and experimented with implementing higher fidelity assets, which neccessitated a slightly different workflow. I believe the art style was one of our most successful decisions. Not only did players enjoy the aesthetic, but it proved to be very time-efficient, as it required very few frames of animation to achieve the choppy, yet still intentional, look

All in all, I'm very happy with the experience we were able to architect.
